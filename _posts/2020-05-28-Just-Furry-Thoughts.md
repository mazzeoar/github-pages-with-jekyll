You know I'm worried that one day I'll be applying for a job or something 
and I'll have on my resume that I know Github and they'll go to my 
account and see this Furry website and think that I'm not a good
candidate for the job becuase I was messing around making a website about
furries but hopefully after reading this they will realize that I was just 
doing the Github pages course and in order to memorize the process better I 
made it about something super weird like furries. I hope that the potential
employer is impressed by my forethought of the situation at this point and 
gives me the job that would be pretty cool.
